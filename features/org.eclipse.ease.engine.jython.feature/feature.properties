 #	A large portion of the dictionary entries\n\

 #	Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.\n\
 #	\n\
 #	Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its\n\
 #	original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED\n\
 #	that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear\n\
 #	on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially\n\
 #	in the same form as set out herein and that such intended\n\
 #	distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise\n\
 #	contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having\n\
 #	jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.\n\
 #	\n\
 #	NO WARRANTY\n\
 #	\n\
 #	The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the\n\
 #	research and development conducted during the project and is provided\n\
 #	to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the\n\
 #	program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,\n\
 #	implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein\n\
 #	includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,\n\
 #	performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of\n\
 #	the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of\n\
 #	any right of any third party.\n\
 #	\n\
 #	Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to\n\
 #	have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for\n\
 #	the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or\n\
 #	otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.\n\
 #	\n\
 #	Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other\n\
 #	organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the\n\
 #	development of the program and their respective officials, directors,\n\
 #	officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all\n\
 #	damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental\n\
 #	and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection\n\
 #	with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material\n\
 #	or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,\n\
 #	regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had\n\
 #	knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the\n\
 #	project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the\n\
 #	foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term\n\
 #	"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,\n\
 #	modification, copying and distribution of the program and the\n\
 #	production of secondary products from the program.\n\
 #	\n\
 #	In the case where the program, whether in its original form or\n\
 #	modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from\n\
 #	any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or\n\
 #	grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in\n\
 #	writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted\n\
 #	from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted\n\
 #	above as far as the program is concerned.\n\

5. Time Zone Database\n\
\n\
ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone Database section 7.\n\
\n\
7.  Database Ownership\n\
\n\
   The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\n\
   document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\n\
   that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public\n\
   domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply\n\
   to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make to it.\n\
   Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ Database,\n\
   the organization that is providing the IANA Considerations defined in\n\
   this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with the IETF,\n\
   currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all competent court\n\
   orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN or the IETF Trust\n\
   on the database or the code.  Any person making a contribution to the\n\
   database or code waives all rights to future claims in that\n\
   contribution or in the TZ Database.\n
